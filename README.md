# QUIZ APPLICATION

Created an MCQ (Multiple Choice Questions) app with a countdown timer.
Only HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript were used to create this project.

- On the Start page, users will see the required time and number of questions. Users will also see a start button. When a user clicks on that button they will be forwarded to the MCQ page.

- On the MCQ page, the user will see the countdown timer, all the MCQs, and the finish exam button. Users will only be able to select an answer one time per question just like in the real-life MCQ exam.
  The timer section should be fixed all the time at the top of the page.

- Once the user clicks the Finish button, they should be forwarded to the Result page. On the Result page, there will be scores that the user has achieved.

- If the user times out then they will automatically be forwarded to the Timeout page.
